#soap requests

trying to make a soap request to  a wsdl and read the result and pass it to a json string

using this 
https://www.w3schools.com/xml/tempconvert.asmx?wsdl
from w3schools

not the cleanest example considering the soap data has to be stripped off before proceeding with the rest of the parsing of the xml.
